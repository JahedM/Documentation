# Problem Statement
Web3 is growing fast, but we still lack a proper way to verify organizations. At the institutional level, we have a combination of CAs, Qualified Digital Signature, and Standardization Bodies (ISO, UNE…). All of these traditional institutions are usually aencies with no transparency, no interoperability, and no modern tools to develop applications on top of them.
 
In the traditional Identity Landscape, Trust is achieved by centralization and protection of already existing players. Innovation is always slow and limited to a small set of participants.
 
On the other side, DAOs are becoming more popular and gaining traction as a transparent and efficient way of achieving consensus on different aspects of Society.
 
# SSI and why it's not working
Self-Sovereign Digital Identity is built upon public-key cryptography and blockchain technologies, making it possible to independently publish and verify the identity of individuals, organizations, and their devices, without the involvement of a trusted intermediary (traditionally, a certificate authority). This can provide effective resistance to censorship, manipulation of data, and mass surveillance by eliminating the necessity of trusted third parties. The use of a public blockchain is necessary to make distributed identity possible.
 
Instead of trusting certificate authorities and centralized identity registries to hold the keys, Self-Sovereign Digital Identity allows users to keep their own private keys and their data private, and build a set of attestations or proofs about their identity, to which they can control access. They can even avoid sharing the actual data, and instead use zero-knowledge proofs to demonstrate that certain facts about them are true (e.g. proof of age, residency, nationality) without sharing their personally identifiable information.
 
Verifiable Credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver's licenses are used to assert that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle, university degrees can be used to assert our level of education, and government-issued passports enable us to travel between countries. This specification provides a mechanism to express these sorts of credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable.
 
## Why is not working
Even though there are many great initiatives in SSI, we still lack a common language for Verifiable Credentials to be completely interoperable. We still miss a trusted mechanism to decide on how these credentials are created, how do they evolve. We need coordination in the management of standards, and also on how power is equilibrated in the issuance of credentials. Who can issue what is still a missing link in the SSI ecosystem
 
## Certificate Authorities
From the Wikipedia: In cryptography, a certificate authority or certification authority (CA) is an entity that issues digital certificates. A digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate. This allows others (relying parties) to rely upon signatures or on assertions made about the private key that corresponds to the certified public key. A CA acts as a trusted third party—trusted both by the subject (owner) of the certificate and by the party relying upon the certificate. The format of these certificates is specified by the X.509 or EMV standard.
 
Trust on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on a selected group of institutions serving as trusted third parties to issue digital certificates. While the system works well enough for most relations with the public administration, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust-based model.
 
# Unite DAO
A DAO to achieve Trustless Interoperability
Unit DAO is a coordination framework to elaborate and evolve standards. It is based On three principles: Coordination, Verification, and Automation
 
## Coordination: Community-driven mechanism to elaborate and evolve standards.
Verification: Reputational Digital Identity for Organisations. Who they are, and what they can do.
Automation: On-chain and off-chain Issuance, verification, and revocation of Credentials
Three Steps to trustless Interoperability
 
### Step 1: Coordination
Cooperation is not possible without a common language we all agree on. And building this common framework should be a coordination task. That's why a DAO is a perfect instrument for that.
 
Also, Standards should be created by those using them, with Skin in the Game, not from remote offices by professional politicians.
 
To achieve that we need to create four main frameworks to work on:
- Protocols
- Compliance (security)
- DeFi
- Metaverse & NFT
- Security
 
It's getting more important every day to verify that a Smart Contract has been issued by the correct organization, that has already been audited by a known company, verified in the DAO and allowed to issue a -Security TAG, and that the company works at the highest level of security constrains.
 
**DeFi**
Also, financial information could help take better decisions (even automated) on Risk Management and/or Investment opportunities. A verified company, with the right to isse these TAGs, could verify the TVL and/or the APY of another contract as a TAG
 
**And Many more**
DAO Governance, NFT applications, Local commerce,
 
### Step 2: Verification
Verifiable Credentials, once identified, must be issued to organizations, but once again, we need coordination in the verification of participants in the DAO.
- Verification Process
- Staking
- Vigilantes
 
**Verification Process**
Trusted Organizations will act as Certificate Authorities (CAs) in the DAO, we call this process Trust Mining. By verifying organizations in the DAO, and not letting bad players enter, the TO will receive -rewards in the form of SAO tokens.
 
First Organizations acting as TOs will be the ones participating in the Private Sale, doing a proper KYB, and being approved initially by all other organizations.
 
**Staking**
Trusted Organizations will act as Certificate Authorities (CAs) in the DAO, we call this process Trust Mining. By verifying organizations in the DAO, 
 
**Vigilantes**
Gamification: By proving wrong organizations and/or wrong certificates being issued, whatchDogs

### Step 3 : Automation
Step Three: who can issue every standard
 
Finally, we arrive at the end of this awesome journey. Thanks to the coordination and the verification that UNIT DAO provides the working groups will also be in charge of automation processes.
What do we mean by automation? Well, that's a very good question. When we talk about automation we are referring to multiple meanings.
 
The key to this question is to understand the 3 mentioned steps as a whole interconnected process
 
Once organized and coordinated the working groups

An example of this could be the automatization of protocols and DAOs verifications. Let's say a DeFi platform wants to get verified, but, verified on what?  Smart contract auditions, front end security, enough decentralization. The list could go on...
 
We need an automated process in order to speed up and facilitate the issuance of certificates and verifications. And not letting bad players enter, the TO will receive rewards in the form of CAELUM tokens.
 
# Introduction to Unit DAO Tokenomics

## Unit DAO essence
When we take a look into Unit DAO structure and functions we can notice that the final goal is to create the first council’s framework within the decentralized ecosystem to enable the continuous creation and evolution of standards.
 
That sounds pretty cool but when it comes to coordinating people and organizations everything turns into a complete mess.
 
We can not base a whole project only on good human behavior and altruism to develop and expand decetralized ecosystem.
 
This is the reason for Unit DAO tokenomics. 
 
## Tokenomics
Unit DAO tokenomics aims to answer two main questions with a mathematical reliable approach:
 
The first one is, how do we maintain and guarantee a sustainable and effective decentralization of voting power?
The second one, how do we keep Unit DAO community engaged and incentivized?
 
Those two questions must be answered taking in mind one thing, Fides organic value increases over time.
 
## Treasury location
If we take a look into FIDE distribution we can observe that most of FIDE tokens will be minted within the DAO treasury.
 
Thanks to this amount of capital we aim to be self-sustainaible. That means we are looking to generate a capital increase over time, which will allow the development and evolution of UNIT DAO.
 
In order to achieve this goal multiple tokenomic theories had been analyzed and synthesized. We are focusing on a way to increase the investment value at the same time that we bankroll the ecosystem develpoment.
 
## FIDE Token
The FIDE Token is a Governance Token.
Fide is Unit DAO governance token.
 
When we explain what it Fide we could say it's something more than the simple tokenization of voting power.
 
That means that each FIDE gives voting power to its holder. During the first stages of Unit DAO, that voting power will be useable at the 4 main frameworks mentioned before.
 
That means that Fide Token Holders will be the ones who vote for candidates to become part of the working groups.
 
Those working groups will eventually determine and create the standards that will be applied to the whole ecosystem framework.
