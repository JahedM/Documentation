# Building Community


Project success also depends on a solid and engaged community. So let's dive deep into Unite DAO community-building strategy to understand how we will build.


**Goals:**

- Build a solid and engaged community.
- Create and maintain community channels: Discord, Twitter, Telegram, Youtube.
- Create Content Strategies for the different channels.


**Key questions:**

- *What macro content will we create?
- *On what channels will we create it?
- *How will we repurpose Macro-content into Micro?
- *How will we distribute that Micro-content?
- *How will we listen to our audience? 
- *How will we measure our KPI’s?


**Macro-content:**

**Youtube.**
Our focus will be on the Youtube channel. This will be our main Macro channel. The first 6 episodes will be with Alex Puig (Alex) and Arturas Salnikovas (Art). Later we will invite other team members from different departments to speak and share experiences also after that we will start with guests There will be a schedule of invitations with various projects and entrepreneurs from the crypto space. 


**Micro-content:**

**Social media posts.**
We have ready the main social media platforms for our content distribution. We will make a long-form video for Youtube first, then - we will distribute this video in short chunks across all our social media channels: Twitter, Telegram, Discord, Medium, Reddit, Instagram, LinkedIn, Substack.


## Content strategy:

Inspiration — Problems and questions people ask in our niche. 
We can look at socials and get inspiration for content. 

Keywords — Main keywords. 
E.g., Web3 Standards, NFT gaming, Interoperability, DAO. 
Keywords will be the central axis where we will create our content around. 

Keyword Research — Use Google and Youtube auto-complete functions to find keywords.

Develop Content Ideas — Three main categories of content:
Motivational content - 5 keywords x 10 ideas = 50 peaces of content.
Educational content - 5 keywords x 10 ideas = 50 peaces of content.
Actionable content - 5 keywords x 10 ideas = 50 peaces of content.

3 categories of content X 5 keywords X 10 ideas each = 150 content/month

Create amazing content — Start content production:
Anything that adds value to the viewer/reader.
Make sure your 3 things are right:
Titles
Keywords
Links

Content Marketing — Start promoting the content:
Organic -— All our social network channels.
